# **Plas Penmynydd**
## **Site Overview**

Plas Penmynydd is a private home in rural Anglesey, North Wales. it has the most incredible history that its current owner has spent a lifetime restoring and sharing with others. Plas Penmynydd is the ancestral home of the Tudor family and birthplace of Owain Tudor, Grandfather of Henry VII. This website primarily provides a formal platform that lets people know that the house is open to the public during specific periods of the year. This was the main remit of this website, to provide an attractive, proffesional looking site that provided information regarding how to find the house and when to visit. Many people have visited the house over the years through open days advertised locally and through one off chance visits but the owner would like to reach a wider audience. Another aspect that was important was education - regarding the significant history of the house. This is explored in the history page and will no doubt be an ongoing project.

## **Planning stage**
### **Target Audiences:**
* Users keen to visit Plas Penmynydd
* Users with an interest in Welsh History 
* Users interested in learning more about the Tudor's of North Wales
* Users who have an interest in historic houses 

### **User Stories:**
* As a user, I would like the subject of a website to be immediately clear.
* As a user, I would like to be able to navigate a site intuitively with ease.
* As a user, I would like clear information regarding how to visit Plas Penmynydd.
* As a user, I would like to be presented with visual imagery that gives me an insight into what kind of house Plas Penmynydd is.
* As a user I would like to learn more about the historical significance of Plas Penmynydd
* As a user, I would like to be able to contact Plas Penmynydd with potential queries. 

### **Site Aims:**
* To provide clear information as to how and when to visit Plas Penmynydd.
* To provide an 'Explore Plas Penmynydd' section with strong photographs that gives the user a sense of what Plas Penmynydd is like. 
* To provide the user with information about the house history
* To provide the user with information regarding Owain Tudor and the Tudor's of North Wales
* To provide the user a way to contact the site author for further info, questions and queries.


### **How Is This Will Be Achieved:**
* The home page will focus primarily on 1. When the house is open 2. Ticket information 3. Where to find the house. There will be a short blurb that highlights the historical link with the Tudors and an explore gallery of visually appealing interior and exterior shots of the house.

* The site will have a history page that will be easily navigated via image links that focus on the house history and the history of the Tudors.

* The site will have a contact page, allowing the user to easily get in touch, should they need too. 

* Through utilising simple design the site aims to be easily accessible by all. This is something that has been in the forefront of my mind as the demographic of those who visit the house tends to be on the older side. 

### **Wireframes:**
In order to achieve a website that looked as proffesional as possible it was important to carefully consider the design of the pages. To that end the first stage of this project involved creating wireframes for both both mobile and desktop devices. 

* Mobile Wireframes:
    * [Homepage (About)](docs/wireframes/homepage-mobile.png)
    * [Teachings page](docs/wireframes/teaching-mobile.png)
    * [Community page](docs/wireframes/community-mobile.png)
    * [Contact page](docs/wireframes/contact-mobile.png)

* Desktop wireframes:
    * [Homepage (About)](docs/wireframes/homepage-desktop.png)
    * [Teachings page](docs/wireframes/teachings-desktop.png)
    * [Community page](docs/wireframes/community-desktop.png)
    * [Contact page](docs/wireframes/contact-desktop.png)

There was some deviation from the original wireframes:

* The inclusion of a text box 'Visit Plas Penmynydd: the birthplace of a Royal Dynasty' along with a down icon linking to visiting information. This was suggested by my mentor, Richard Wells, who was concerned the user might feel lost in the hero image. The addition of this text box serves to improve the users experience of navigating the page.

* The exclusion of social media links in the footer, this was owing to the house owners request not to have to involve themselves in socials.


### **Color Scheme:**
From the beginning I was keen to give the website an elegant look and have opted for simplicity. I began with a body background color of a very light shade of off-white, as I found this more subtle than antique white. I then experimented with red and green, settling on shades that I felt contrasted well with one another and which felt warm and inviting. Ive utilised subtle color transitions on the nav bar and footer by using linear gradients. This was in aid of softening the page and reducing the starkness of large blocks of solid color.  

## **Current Features Common to all pages**
###  **Header Element**
I choose not to use a header and instead opted for a simple nav bar at the top of the page. 

#### *Title:*
![Page title](docs/screenshots/title.jpg)

* The title of the page is Plas Penmynydd, this being the House name. Plas translates from welsh to House and Penmynydd translates to hill, so essentially house on the hill. 
* The title also serves as a navigation link to the homepage as we have come to expect as internet users. 


#### *Logos:*
* The chosen logo is the tudor shield, it is easily recognisable as such and feels apt given the tudor lineage linked to the house. It adds visual appeal and draws the eye to the website brand name: Plas Penmynydd. 


    * Whilst the nav-links collapse on mobile device I have decided to keep the logo alongside of Plas Penmynydd owing to the fact that it looked better with, than without. 

        ![Mobile header](docs/screenshots/mobile-header.jpg)

    * Desktop logo adjusts in size depending on screen size as it utilises bootstrap 5 responsiveness. 

        ![Desktop header](docs/screenshots/desktop-header.jpg)

#### *Navigation Bar:*
* The navigation bar appears on all three pages at the top of the page where it is fixed with the bootstrap class .sticky-top. There were other options that could have been explore for example having Plas Penmynydd in a header above the nav bar, however, I really wanted to keep the site simple and straightforward. In addition, I wanted the user's focus to be drawn to the hero image. 
* The navigation bar contains links to the homepage (through the plas penmynydd navbrand), History and contact us pages.Its sticky position has the effect that the user can easily navigate between the pages at anytime. 
* To ease user navigation there is an active class that shows the user which page they are currently on - the below image shows the active home page which appears white, whilst the other pages appear pink. This is subtle, but hopefully not to subtle. 
* When the navlinks are hovered over the text of the navlink turns a contrasting green color and is underlined.

### **Homepage**:
#### *Hero-Image:*
The hero image shows a side view of Plas Penmynydd with a lion statue in the foreground. Its an interesting image that I hope serves to grab the users attention. The hero image is large and intended to be the first thing the user sees. However, given its size I was encouraged by my mentor to provide a text box that directed the user to look down the page and find the visitor information. 
![Homepage hero image](docs/screenshots/)
#### *Visit Plas Penmynydd text box*
Essentially this exists to directed the users focus down the page and onto the visiting information section. However, it became a good way of selling the Plas and drawing attention to what makes it so historically interesting - namely its link with the Tudor dynasty. Through using a font awesome downward icon I have embedded an anchor link that if clicked takes you to the visiting information section of the homepage. On a mobile device this text box disapears as its not needed given the scaling down of the hero image. 
![Homepage hero image text box](docs/screenshots/)

####*Visitor information section*
This is organised into three columns: Opening hours, Ticket prices and directions. Again, the focus was on being as simple as possible. Fontawesome icons serve to draw focus and add interest. In the directions column there is an iframe containing googlemap directions for the Plas. Using bootstrap made the organisation of these columns straightforward. particularly when it came to making them responsive. On mobile devices the three columns are reduced to one so as the content of each heading takes up the entire screen width.

####*Explore Plas Penmynydd section*
This is the final section of the homepage. This comprises of a gallery of photos of the Plas with short descriptions underneathe. To make the captions more visible against the photos I have used some css customisations - by using a black background with an opacity of 0.1 I have given the white text a bit more contrast which has aided the readability of the text. 
![Homepage explore Plas Penmynydd gallery](docs/screenshots/)

### **History page**:
#### *Image links*
This history page is very heavy on text information with six seperate headings. These sections have been arranged so as they can be navigated to through the use of this image menu. Using a text overlay upon hovering over the image keeps the image simple and uncluttered. Users are good at recognising images as navigational links and the use of the text overlay serves to highlight that these are links to the different headings within the page. The six sections are: 1. The life of Owain Tudor 2. Tudors in North Wales 3. Penmynydd Church 4. The history of Plas Penmynydd 5. Plas Penmynydd restoration process 6. Historic features of the house. I will focus on the first two in this readme file. 
![History link images](docs/screenshots/)
#### *The life of Owain Tudor:*
To structure these sections uniformaly bootstrap containers have been used. Text and images appears on tablets and desktop devices as occupying 8 columns. Whilst quoteboxes with interesting facts occupies the final 4. On mobile screens this is all collapsed down to one column that takes up the entire screen width. This is then repeated through all six sections of history. The only departure from this is in the Historical features of the house section, here a carousel is used in place of an image as there are several images showing various shields and inscriptions.

### **Contact us page :**
#### *Background-Image:*
This image is taken in the study of Plas Penmynydd and features the library bookcases. The intention was to provide a backdrop that was visually stimulating but did not distract too much from the contact form which floats transparently over the image. 
![Contact page](docs/screenshots/)
#### *Contact page:form*
The form requires that all inputs are fulfilled in order to send and uses placeholders to direct the user. It was coded using bootstrap 5 and customised so as to visually appealing against the background image. The submit button is styled using the green that is used throughout the project. The headings too use the same white and off white to give a cohesive feel to the webpages. 
![Contact page form](docs/screenshots/)

## **Footer**
* The footer is simple and unfussy. It features Jasper Tudor (son of Owain Tudor) coat of arms which is set against a green background that has a transition gradient with a lighter green to soften the large block of color. Without social media links the footer has become more of a stylistic element that one with a practical use. however, it does serve to give a balance to the pages. 
![Page footer](docs/screenshots/)

## **Typography**
* In this project just one font-family was used:
  *  EB Garamond with a fallback font of serif
* This font was chosen as it has the elegant appearance that was appropiate for a historic house website. 
* This font was sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits. Whilst I did import another font, Roboto, this font did not compliment the project in the way I hoped. 

## **Individual Page Content features**
### **Homepage Content:**

* The content of this page fulfils the first two aims of this website. 1. it provides clear information as to how and when to visit Plas Penmynydd with directions provided via address and googlemap link. 2. The 'Explore Plas Penmynydd' image carousel gives a strong impression of what the house looks like - which is important because not everyone will be able to visit who has an interest in its history. The homepage with its short blurb beneath the hero image also clearly lays out the historical significance of the house and leads to a better user understanding - eg. this is what the house looks like, this is why its historically unique and this is how you can visit. It clearly leads the user in a way that is informative and concise
![Home page blurb](docs/screenshots/)

### **History Page Content:**
* Includes six sections, each section has a unique anchor that allows the user to pick and choose which section to read from the image menu. To meet the aim of educating the user about the unique history of the house it was necessary to provide a comprehesive history section. Owain Tudor is not a well known figure amongst the Tudors and so its necessary to give the user more information about his life in a way that is engaging and adds to a users appreciation of Plas Penmynydd. To this end paragraphs are kept as short as possible. Text is broken up through the use of images and figcaptions that provide a little visual stimulation and pertain to the subject being discussed. 
* The six sections each cover an element that adds to and brings life into the history of house.
* all images are taken by myself with the exception of the image in the 'Life of Owain Tudor' - this image comes from adobe stock images and is properly licensed for use. 
* Images are wrapped in a figure element and given a figcaption to detail who the image portrays.
* blockquotes are used to contain interesting facts for each section and these are given a subtle background color to help them stand out from the page. These too are wrapped in a figure element.

![Zoomed out image of the history page content section](docs/screenshots/)

### **Contact Us Page Content:**

* Offers a way for the user to contact me as the site author should they have any questions. This fulfils the final site aim. 
* With minimal features and complexity to add to usebility and a better user experience, this page consists of a h2 and h4 heading elements with a simple bootstrap form beneath and to the center of the page. This form has just three inputs - name, email and message. Followed by a send button. This has then been customised through css to give it a consistency in terms of color and font style with the rest of the website.
* On mobile view this form content takes up much more of the  viewing screen and this is to optimise user experience, as it makes the form far more readable and easier to use.

## **Future-Enhancements**

* The future intention of the site would be to incorporate a 3d house tour. The demographic who are most interested in the house are older people who arent always mobile enough to visit historic homes. This would be a great way to make the house and its fascinating history more accesible. Additionally, this is a private home and so public openings are limited to one day a week during the summer months - so again, this provides another avenue to provide a more virtual experience of the house. Its a massive hurdle for charities like the National Trust wheelchair accesible and this is also a case for private homes, with a grade I listed building making such alterations just is not possible. Providing this virtual tour serves to include a demographic who I suspect would not be able to visit the house in person. 

* It has been the house owners lifetimes work to restore the house. He has so much knowledge about the intricate history of the house that he would like to share. Future enhancements will be history sections added to and rewritten to incorporate his immense knowledge and really to preserve his legacy as well as the house.

* I would also make the contact form fully functional with a post request.

## **Credits**
* The code used to provide transition effect on the Homepage Carousel was found through the slack community channel, where someone had previously struggled with the same issue I was having. I was able to take some of the code provided there and incorporate it into my project. 
* The overlay effect on the history page images elluded me for the longest time, I am so grateful to the code institute tutor who broke down what it was I was tryign to achieve and provided a clear way forward. 
### **Acknowledgements**
I would like to thank my fellow students of code institutes June Wales intake, a lovely group of people who are just lovely and keep the momentum going even when things look a bit daunting. and special mention to:

* [Richard Wells](https://github.com/D0nni387) - Code Institute Mentor who has gone above and beyond what was expected of him to help me get this far in the course.
