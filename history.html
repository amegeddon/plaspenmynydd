          <h2 id="owain">The life of Owain Tudor </h2>
          </br>
          <p>Owain Tudor, a figure of historical intrigue and romance, lived a life marked by unexpected twists and enduring love. Born in the early 1400s in Wales, he started as a simple squire but soon found himself at the heart of English history. Owain's destiny took an astonishing turn when he caught the eye of the formidable widow, Queen Catherine of Valois, after her husband King Henry V's death. Their clandestine romance blossomed into a marriage that scandalized the English court, for Owain was neither noble nor English. Yet, their love endured, and they bore two children, linking their lineage to the royal Tudor dynasty. Owain's life journey, from humble beginnings to the inner circles of power and love, adds a captivating chapter to the tapestry of the Tudor legacy, one steeped in passion and resilience.</p>
          <p>Numerous theories abound about Owen Tudor's early life. Some speculate that he fought at Agincourt and rose to become an esquire in the service of King Henry V. In 16th-century France, whispers suggested he was the illegitimate son of an alehouse keeper, while 18th-century Welsh tales painted his father as a fugitive murderer. These rumors, however, lack solid foundations and highlight the vast speculation surrounding Owen Tudor's origins. What we do know is that in May 1421, a man named 'Owen Meredith' entered the service of Sir Walter Hungerford, steward of the king's household during the French campaign. Beyond this point, Owen's life becomes veiled in mystery once more.</p>
          <p>It was during these enigmatic years that Owain Tudor encountered Queen Catherine, a meeting that has fueled the imagination of romantics, historical fiction authors, and poets for generations. Legend whispers that their connection began with Owain quite literally falling into Catherine's lap during a dance, while another tale insists it was Owain Tudor's prowess in the water that caught the Queen's attention. Regardless of the circumstances, their ensuing relationship would forever alter the course of English monarchy, ushering out the Plantagenet dynasty and ushering in their own Tudor legacy.</p>

          <h2 id="tudors">The Tudors of North Wales</h2>
          </br>
          <p>Ednyfed Fychan, a noble from 12th-century North Wales, led a life defined by remarkable turns of fate. Although not a royal prince, his valorous acts and strategic marriage laid the foundation for the Tudor dynasty's ascent. In a fierce battle against English forces, Ednyfed's unwavering loyalty to his Welsh Princes shone brightly. He beheaded three English lords, presenting their heads as tribute to his Prince. This audacious act earned him the unique distinction of changing his family's coat of arms to display three heads, a vivid testament to his unwavering loyalty and significance.
          <p>Serving as a seneschal, Ednyfed held a role akin to that of a chief counselor. His responsibilities included overseeing feasts, ceremonies, and the administration of justice within the kingdom. His loyalty was further rewarded with titles and privileges, even extending to a role in a Crusade, during which King Henry III personally presented him with a silver cup. Yet, it was his strategic marriage to Gwenllian ferch Rhys, uniting two noble Welsh families, that charted the course for the Tudor dynasty's emergence. The impact of this dynasty would reverberate throughout history, reshaping the English monarchy and continuing to exert influence even on today's royal family.</p>    
          <p>Ednyfed Fychan, often overshadowed by the annals of history, stands as a testament to the unforeseen twists of fate, loyalty, and the profound influence of individuals on the destiny of dynasties.</p>

              <p>Owain Tudor broke away from the traditional Welsh patronymic system and instead chose the fixed surname of Tudor rather than Owain ap Maredudd ap Tudur ap Goronwy ap Tudur ap Goronwy ap Ednyfed Fychan. It was a prescient choice, for Tudur or Tudor comes from the Brythonic tud (territory) and rhi (king).</p>

      <h2 id="church">St. Gredifael's Church, Penmynydd </h2>
      </br>
      <p>St. Gredifael's Church in Penmynydd stands as a poignant symbol of the Tudor dynasty's Anglesey roots. Nestled within its hallowed walls lies the tomb of Gronw Tudur, a significant figure in the Tudor lineage and the great-uncle of Henry VII. The Penmynydd estate was once home to five brothers, one of whom was Gronw, whose effigy adorns the oldest tomb in the church. Another brother, Meredudd, had a son named Owain Tudur, who would go on to join Henry V's army and become a member of the royal court circle. </p>
      <p>The 14th century alabaster tomb pays homage to Gronw Fychan and his wife Myfanwy and their link to the Tudor lineage in Anglesey. Its sides are adorned with five shields each, interspersed with canopied niches for statues, evoking a sense of grandeur. Gronw Fychan himself is portrayed robustly, clad in armour with a surcoat, his head encased in chain-mail, and his moustache gracing the top. His feet rest upon a regal lion. Myfanwy, in striking contrast, is adorned with intricate clothing and ornaments. Her head is framed by two angelic wings, and beneath her, two lapdogs find comfort. This tomb stands as an enduring tribute to a rich history, etched in stone and alabaster.</p>
      <p>The church itself, as it stands today, harks back to the 1400s, a testament to the family's prominence during that era. However, the land on which it stands has a far older history, dating back to the 6th century when it was consecrated by Gredifael. Gredifael was the son of a Breton migrant, part of a wave of Christians who settled in the area, leaving an enduring legacy that would be intertwined with the future of the Tudor dynasty.</p>
